### [Click here to use the converter.](https://travisgk.github.io/long-s-converter/)
This is a JavaScript tool that converts given text to use the archaic letter known as the long S ( Å¿ ) in its output. It's a JavaScript version of my original Python code found at [long-s](https://github.com/travisgk/py-long-s).
